# Key terms

The terms listed below are intentionally framed in plain language, or words that are commonly used in conversation. A wide range of disciplines discuss, document, study, and ameliorate trauma, including: behavioral health, psychology. Each discipline has specialist terms to describe various aspects of trauma; these are listed in the 'related terms' section below each main term. Experts related to terms are also listed below.

{% assign termlist = site.data.terms | where_exp: "item", "item.categories contains page.categories" %}
{% assign introterms = site.data.terms | where_exp: "item", "item.tags contains 'intro'" %}
{% assign harms = site.data.terms | where: "tags", "harms" %}
{% assign helps = site.data.terms | where: "tags", "helps" %}
{% assign hrcd = site.data.terms | where: "tags", "hrcd" %}

## Trigger self-care and first aid
When a trigger is experienced, there are many strategies from a wide range of knowledge traditions that can assist a triggered person with regulating, and accelerate returning to a non-triggered state. Some of the ones listed below we have found personally helpful.

<ul>
  <li>jin shen point 17 - deactivates the vagus nerve</li>
  <li>3-4-5 breathing - stimulates the respiratory pacemaker in the brain</li>
  <li>orienting ("here we all are, safe together") - speeds reversal of amygdala hijack through combination of somatic experiencing and prefrontal reasoning.</li>
  <li>breath of fire - stimulates the respiratory pacemaker in the brain</li>
  <li>chanting</li>
  <li>therapeutic tremoring</li>
  <li>patting</li>
  <li>grounding</li>
  <li>high energy movement / dancing</li>
</ul>
